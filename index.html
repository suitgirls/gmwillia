    1. Gia Williams

    2. Class of 2027/ Washington DC
    
    3. Because I am apart pf black girls code and wanted to experience technology to see if it could be a possible major for me.
    
    4. Forensic Technology
    
    5. I think am pretty similar outside of school. I do all-star cheer and track, and musical theater, coding, and volunteering. Some of my favorite shows are Gilmore Girls, Dynasty, Shameless, Everybody hates Chris, Black-Ish and Love Island and I love to binge watch these shows at the same time with my friends so we can discuss them. An all time favorite movie for me will always be Princess and the Frog. My favorite books thus far are The Hate You Give & Concrete Rose one of the best sequel's in my opinion. Reading the two very different books gives you a whole different perspective on both stories and how they came to be. Fun fact I did a monologue based of Concrete Rose in 8th Grade English. My father died when I was just 2 so it has just been me and my mom for as long as I can remember until we got a small shih-zui named Cupcake. She is 5 and the most annoying adorable dog ever! That is a little bit about me.
    
    6. Warning I am very energetic when I am not hungry and tired, and I am very excited to continue to make friends here.
