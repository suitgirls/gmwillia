    Hi! My name is Gia Williams and I am a rising sopohmore and St. Andrews Episicopal School in Potomac Maryland, but I live in Washington DC. I am interested in the Medical Field currently but more specifically Forensic Science.
</p>
<p>
    I do All-Star cheer year round, and trakc & volleyball for my school teams. I also do Musical Theater and volunteering in my free time. 
</p>
<p>
    Its just be my mother and I most of my life but when I was 8 we got a tiny dog and her name is Cupcake, and we are just one small yet happy family. 
</p>
<p>
    I have alot of favorite shows but my personal favorites are Gilmore Girls, Dynasty, Shameless, Black-Ish, and Love Island. While I am not the biggest reader a certain sequel that kept me hooked was The Hate You Give & Concrete Rose by Angie Thomas. Fun fact I did a monologue based of Concrete Rose in 8th Grade English class. That is a little bit about me!
