            Mary Louise Prather was one the developers of cryptography, and she was also an American spy. Prathers work took place during WWII and the Cold War.  In 1938 she joined the SIS, also known as the Signal Intelligence Service. In 2 years she was promoted to Chief of the Stenographic section, where she had the important job of translating the enemy's corded messages. In 1946 Prather was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award. In the 50s has her duties, responsibilities, and position increased, and in the 60 she was awarded the biggest promotion of her time, which was the Chief of The Soviet Information Division.

            Throughout her time with SIS, she worked a variety of jobs where she could have access to the various machines, and she also worked as the sorter, reproducer, tabulator, and key punch. While starting as a clinical worker she climbed to the chain of command which was unheard of for a woman at the time. As I said Prather also worked with intercepting messages from enemies. This part of her work was very secret, since it was illegal during the time of WWII.

            One of Prathers most remarkable awards was the Meritorious Civilian Service Award awarded to her 1969. This was awarded to her in recognition of her several coded Japanese messages. The messages she discovered later lead to the breaking of the Japanese sending encrypted messages.  Prather has left a long lasting legacy because of her dedication to improving and organization. And of course most importantly accessibility of information. Her contributions benefit users and people in her professions now.
